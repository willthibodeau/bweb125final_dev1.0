      <h1>Pack Monument</h1>
      <p><img src="images/pack.jpg" alt="monument" width="200" height="300">The Square, a crossroads in early Asheville, was the first location of mercantile stores and inns. Native American trails guided settlers to this site, where in 1793 the Buncombe County Court placed the first courthouse, prison and stocks. With the opening of the Buncombe Turnpike in 1827, this public square became a crossroads for stagecoach travelers and a gathering place for drovers who herded cattle, hogs and turkeys to markets farther south.</p>
      <p>The public square has been a central feature of Asheville since the town's creation in 1797. The county court ordered that lands for a public square be procured in the "most convenient and interesting" place. Lying at the intersection of ancient trading paths, the site chosen encompassed the important existing public and commercial buildings of the area and established in essence, a focal point for Asheville’s future growth.</p>
      <p>Local architect Richard Sharp Smith designed the Vance Monument which was erected in 1896. The earliest surviving buildings on the square occupy the southwest side and date from the 1890's. This group of buildings, which include examples of the Romanesque Revival style, suffered extensive damage following a fire in 1895 and most were subsequently rebuilt and enlarged. The three-story brick building with a projecting corbelled cornice known as the Adler Building at 9 Pack Square anchors the corner and adjoins the former Western Hotel, which is capped by a richly ornamented pressed metal cornice. Along the south side of the square, a fine collection of early 20th-century commercial buildings survive including the Neo-Classical Commence Building, constructed in 1904, and the reinforced concrete Legal Building built in 1909, designed by Smith and Carrier in the Renaissance Revival style. The 13 story Jackson Building is the last stop on the trail.</p>
      <p>Let's go west along the south side of Patton Ave. where we will come to the next trail stop, a bench with a Top Hat, Cane and Gloves made out of bronze.</p>

      <h1>The Top Hat</h1>
      <p><img src="images/hat.jpg" alt="hat" width="200" height="200">This plaque and artwork were place by friends in honor of Leslie Anderson, director of Asheville's Downtown Development Department between 1986 and 1995. She was picked as one of Asheville's 50 most influential people of the century for her work in bringing about Asheville's downtown renaissance.</p>
      <p>Across the street at 21 Patton Ave is the Kress Building. Constructed in 1927, the Asheville architecture style is an early design that preceded the better known Art Deco Dress stores built in other cities. Notice the Neo Classic motif and cream color glazed terra-cotta tile bordered with distinctive blue and orange rosette tiles on the upper floors of the building. Today the first floor of Kress is home to an arts and crafts emporium. If you walk inside you can admire the architectural details and preview the offerings of more than 80 regional artists.</p>
      <p>Traveling west along the south side of Patton Ave. to the end of the block we will arrive at our next trail station, The DrHumor Building. Pronounced "Drummer".</p>

      <h1>The Drhumor Building</h1>
      
      <p><img src="images/drhumor.jpg" alt="Drhumor Building" width="200" height="200">The DrHumor Building is a monument to Asheville's rich architectural history. The carved frieze portrays imaginative and mythological characters. Built in 1895, and designed by A. L. Milton, this boldly detailed building is the oldest standing commercial building downtown. It features an elaborate exterior limestone frieze crafted by English sculptor Frederic Miles who also worked on the Biltmore house. Some of the allegorical stone images are believe to represent local residents of the era, including at least one local sidewalk superintendent, and the bearded face of florist Cyrus T.C.Deake. </p>
      <p>Next door is the S&W Cafeteria at 56 Patton Ave. widely acclaimed as downtown's most flamboyant Art Deco presentation of Asheville architecture in the Art Deco style. Designed as a cafeteria aby Douglas D. Ellington in 1929, it was constructed at the height of Asheville’s historic building boom. The ornate facade of the 2-story structure is festive and cheerful, displaying a profusion of exuberant stylistic details that include colorful repeating geometric designs of cream, green, blue, black, and gilt glazed terra-cotta tiles, all of which come together in a harmonious whole. The Art Deco theme continues inside in the elegant large dining space whose two story open interior is decorated with a refined geometrically patterned ceiling , wall panels and glittering chandeliers.</p>
      <p>Let's cross Patton Ave. and travel along the west side of Haywood St., past the park, cross College St. continue north along the west side of Haywood street one more block you will make a left turn onto Battery Park Ave. Continue one block until you get to the corner of Wall St. and Battery Park Ave. on the left side you will see the Flat Iron.</p>

      <h1>Flat Iron</h1>
      <p><img src="images/flatiron.jpg" alt="Flat Iron" width="200" height="200"></p>The John Nichols Davis family, owners of the Ashevill3e Laundry, founded in 1893, placed this plaque and artwork in 1997. The 8f foot high statue is a replica of an original laundry-type flat iron use by the laundry in the early years. The statue was designed by Carleton Collins and fabricated of welded steel by Reed Todd. Musicians often perform in front of the sculpture, adding a festive air to this entrance of Wall St, which is one of the city's prettiest and most popular thoroughfares for shopping and dining.</p>
      <p>The Flatiron Building at 10 - 20 Battery Park Ave is one of the most famous and popular of the remaining Asheville architecture buildings. It was designed by Albert C. Wirth and constructed in 1926. It's an elegant Beaux Arts styled 8 story office building faced with limestone. The term "flatiron" refers to its triangular wedge shape that was created to fit the irregular lot.</p>
      <p>Let's go west along the south side of Wall St. to just past the Laughing Seed Cafe. You will see the "Cats" on the wall.</p>

      <h1>Cats</h1>
      <p><img src="images/cats.jpg" alt="Cats" width="200" height="200">Across from the parking garage one can see the stone retaining wall that gives the street its name. Between that wall and the buildings is an alley used by delivery trucks. Wall Street was paved in the mid-1920’s and a sidewalk laid to span the alley, access to these second-story doorways was by footbridge or "Catwalk". </p>
      <p>The doorways on the south side of Wall Street lead to the second level of buildings that front on College Street and Patton Avenue. At one time, footbridges crossed the alley from the wall to the shop entrances. Today we call such bridges "catwalks." This phrase prompted a whimsical interpretation, which resulted in adding bronze cats to commemorate this location. </p>
      <p>Across the street from Laughing Seed Cafe is a climbing wall. Next to the climbing wall are some stairs that lead to Battery Park Ave. Go up the stairs, cross Battery Park Ave and travel north along the east side of Page Avenue until you get to the Bronze Book</p>

      <p><img src="images/book.jpg" alt="Bronze Book" width="200" height="200">Standing at the Bronze Book, which is noted as being signed by several famous people such as George W. Vanderbilt, Who stayed there when he visited in 1888, you can see The Grove Arcade. Often acclaimed as one of downtowns Asheville’s most beautiful building, the Grove Arcade covers an entire city block. Commissioned by Grove and designed by Charles N. Parker it was built in 1929 as one of America's last classic indoor shopping arcades. Both massive and lovely, this Neo-Gothic example of Asheville architecture is sheathed in ivory hued terra-cotta tile, which is softened and embellished with rich detailing around the roof line and windows. At the north side, near Battle Square, admire the pair of "Winded Lion" sculptures fanning the dramatic Entrance. Inside the grand corridor of this elegant structure is a striking and spacious two-story arcade ornately decorated with medieval style grotesques, shields tucked in Roman style niches, Venetian Gothic pointed arches and spiraling wrought-iron staircases. Overhead, a peaked glass ceiling fills the space with diffused, warm sunlight and offers a view of the mountain skies. The arcade's main purpose is to house a fine collection of boutiques, galleries and restaurants.</p>
      <p>Continue along Page Avenue and cross Haywood Street. Take a right and go past Romans, go one more block till you get to West Walnut Street. At the corner of West Walnut Street and Haywood Street you will see our next trail location,

      <p><img src="images/medicinalherbs.jpg" alt="Medicinal Herbs" width="200" height="200">Until the development of shopping malls in the 1970's, Haywood Street was Asheville's premier shipping area. Now part of the Haywood Park Hotel and atrium complex. The building directly across Haywood Street from the Trail Location was built in 1917 by Paul Roebling. At the time, Ashevillians called it "Roebling's Folly" because it was located so far from the square. In time, this area became the home of Sears, Ivey's, Belk’s and the hometown Bon Marche department store. It served as the heart of Asheville's fashionable shopping district for many years. As in cities across the country, many stores left the downtown area during the 1970's, relocating to shopping malls. Only JC Penny remained until 1989. </p>
      <p>Our trail will go east down West Walnut Street Several blocks to the north east corner of North Market Street and East Walnut Street. </p>

      <h1>Jackson Building</h1>
      <p>This neo-gothic building was fully occupied when it opened in 1924. The observation tower had a 400x telescope and an 18 million candlepower searchlight intended to attract tourists. The grotesques on each corner are not functional, there are small holes in the mouths to let water escape and not freeze in the terracotta. The Jackson Building is ranked number 7 among the top 10 tourist attractions in North Carolina.<img src="images/jackson.jpg" alt="Jackson Building" width="200" height="200"></p>
